# QueueProcessor2

# Running the project:
We are adding the executable in the root of the project so you can double click it directly.

* Once you have it running, there will be a grid showing you the default state of the processes and a "Calculate" button.
* Press the button, and the values listed in the grid will be used to demonstrate the run for those specific processes using the "Multilevel Queue" scheduler with both queues using "Round Robin with Preemptive Priority."
* You will have -10,-5,-1,1,5,10 buttons which allow you to navigate within the range of the start (index = 0) through the end (all processes finished).
* When you click through the end, a pop up will arrive that has the results data including, the average turnaround, wait time, and CPU Utilization and the process individual turnaround and wait times.
